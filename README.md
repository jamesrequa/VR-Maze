## VR Maze iPhone App for Google Cardboard

This is a VR app that I created in Unity for Google Cardboard which currently supports iPhone. I plan to port to Android soon.

The objective of the game is to get through the maze and open the door. Since the door only opens with the key, the user must first find the key in the maze and collect coins along the way. I utilized a teleportation waypoint navigation system so the user can easily navigate through the maze.
